// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add
//  at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to 
// write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your 
// name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one 
// sentence describing what the program does.
